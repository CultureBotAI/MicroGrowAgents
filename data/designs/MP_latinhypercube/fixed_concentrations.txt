# Total fixed components: 12 (11 present + 1 excluded)

# RATIONALE FOR FIXED CONCENTRATIONS:
#
# PIPES (20 mM):
# - Standard buffer concentration for pH 6.8-7.2
# - Non-chelating (doesn't interfere with metal availability)
# - Widely used in methylotroph studies
#
# MgCl₂ (0.5 mM):
# - Standard MP medium concentration
# - Essential for ribosome function (no growth below ~0.1 mM)
# - Toxicity only at very high concentrations (>10 mM)
#
# CaCl₂ (0 - EXCLUDED):
# - Ca-free design forces XoxF-dependent growth
# - MxaF (Ca-dependent MDH) cannot function without Ca²⁺
# - Lanthanides (Nd³⁺) replace Ca²⁺ role in this design
#
# ZnSO₄ (5 µM):
# - Required for PQQ biosynthesis (pqq genes encode Zn-dependent enzymes)
# - Metalloenzymes throughout metabolism
# - Standard trace metal concentration
#
# MnCl₂ (2 µM):
# - Superoxide dismutase cofactor (ROS protection)
# - Amino acid biosynthesis
# - Standard trace metal concentration
#
# FeSO₄ (8 µM):
# - Electron transport chain (cytochromes, Fe-S clusters)
# - Could be varied (low Fe induces lanthanophore production)
# - Fixed at moderate level for this design
#
# Molybdenum (0.05 µM):
# - Molybdopterin cofactor biosynthesis
# - Narrow optimal range, not typically varied
#
# Copper (0.5 µM):
# - Oxidases, electron transport
# - Minor trace metal, narrow optimal range
#
# Cobalt (2 µM):
# - Vitamin B12 biosynthesis
# - Originally in varied set, moved to fixed
# - Replaced by lanthanides (more relevant for M. extorquens)
#
# Tungsten (0.05 µM):
# - Can substitute for molybdenum in some enzymes
# - Optional, included at low level
#
# Thiamin (0.5 µM):
# - TPP cofactor (pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase)
# - M. extorquens has partial biosynthesis, benefits from supplementation
#
# Biotin (0.05 µM):
# - Carboxylase cofactor (ACC, PC, PCC)
# - M. extorquens has complete biosynthesis capability
# - Low level supplementation for robustness

# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
# - Fix components with narrow optimal ranges
# - Fix components not central to experimental questions
# - Vary components relevant to lanthanide metabolism & growth
# - Keep LHS dimensions manageable (8 varied components)

# ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATIONS:
# If studying Fe-lanthanide interactions, consider:
#   - Move FeSO₄ to varied set (0.5-20 µM)
#   - Keep CoCl₂ fixed (current design)
#   - Reason: Low Fe induces methylolanthanin (lanthanophore)
#
# If studying trace metal limitations, consider:
#   - Vary multiple trace metals (Zn, Mn, Fe)
#   - Increases LHS dimensions to 10-12 components
#   - Requires 50-120 samples

# QUALITY CONTROL:
# Verify these concentrations by:
# 1. Checking stock solution preparations
# 2. ICP-MS analysis of prepared medium
# 3. Growth tests with fixed-concentration medium (no LHS variation)
# 4. Comparing to published MP medium formulations
