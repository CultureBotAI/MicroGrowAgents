    key_decisions:
      - "Decision: Initial misunderstanding - thought ALL components must be in LHS"
      - "Rationale: User clarified only VARIED components listed, others fixed"
      - "Decision: Identified missing lanthanides as CRITICAL issue"
      - "Rationale: Ca-free medium requires Nd³⁺ for XoxF-MDH to function"
      - "Decision: Identified PQQ range error (1000× too high)"
      - "Rationale: Organism biosynthesizes PQQ; 0-100 µM should be 0-1 µM"
      - "Decision: Keep CoCl₂ AND add NdCl₃ (user decision)"
      - "Rationale: Study both B12/methylotrophy and lanthanide metabolism"
      - "Decision: Create corrected design with 9 varied components"

key_findings:
  - "Original design missing lanthanides → Would cause complete growth failure"
  - "PQQ range 1000× too high (0-100 µM should be 0-1000 nM)"
  - "Phosphate upper bound too wide (100 mM → precipitation risk)"
  - "Citrate lower bound of 0 problematic (need chelation for lanthanides)"
  - "Design has 8 VARIED + 11 FIXED components (20 total including excluded Ca)"
  - "Ca-free medium forces XoxF-dependent growth (requires lanthanide cofactor)"
  - "M. extorquens AM-1 has xoxFG genes (lanthanide-dependent MDH)"
  - "User chose to keep CoCl₂ and add NdCl₃ (9 varied components final)"

recommendations:
  - "Use MP_latinhypercube_list_ranges_REVISED_FINAL.txt for experiments"
  - "Use fixed_concentrations_FINAL.txt for non-varied components"
  - "Apply design constraints when generating LHS samples (precipitation risk)"
  - "Consider varying Fe in future designs (lanthanophore induction)"
  - "Sample size: 45-90 samples (5-10× 9 components)"

errors: []

warnings:
  - "Initial review (DESIGN_REVIEW_REPORT.md) based on incorrect understanding"

critical_corrections:
  - issue: "Missing lanthanides"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    original: "No Nd, La, or Ce in design"
    corrected: "Added NdCl₃·6H₂O (0.5-10 µM) to varied set"
    impact: "Without lanthanides, Ca-free medium would not support growth"
    evidence: "xoxFG genes require Nd³⁺ cofactor, DOI: 10.1038/nature12883"

  - issue: "PQQ concentration range"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    original: "0-100 µM"
    corrected: "0-1000 nM (1 µM)"
    impact: "1000× reduction; original likely toxic at upper bound"
    evidence: "M. extorquens biosynthesizes PQQ, optimal supplement 100-500 nM"

  - issue: "Phosphate upper bound"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    original: "100 mM"
    corrected: "20 mM"
    impact: "Prevents lanthanide phosphate precipitation"
    evidence: "LnPO₄ insoluble above 20 mM phosphate"

  - issue: "Citrate lower bound"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    original: "0 mM"
    corrected: "0.01 mM (10 µM)"
    impact: "Prevents lanthanide precipitation in samples with zero citrate"
    evidence: "Chelation required for Nd³⁺ solubility at pH 7"

design_decisions:
  - decision: "Keep CoCl₂ in varied set"
    alternatives: ["Replace CoCl₂ with NdCl₃ (keep 8 components)", "Add NdCl₃ (go to 9 components)"]
    chosen: "Add NdCl₃, keep CoCl₂ (9 components)"
    rationale: "Study both B12/methylotrophy AND lanthanide metabolism"
    user_input: "keep cocl2 and add NdCl3"
    cost: "~10 more samples (45-90 instead of 40-80)"

  - decision: "Combine or separate phosphates"
    alternatives: ["Keep K₂HPO₄ and NaH₂PO₄ separate", "Combine into 'Total Phosphate'"]
    chosen: "Keep separate"
    rationale: "Maintain consistency with original design intent"
    note: "Could reduce to 8 dimensions by combining"

  - decision: "Vary Fe or keep fixed"
    alternatives: ["Vary FeSO₄ (0.5-20 µM)", "Fix at 8 µM"]
    chosen: "Fix at 8 µM"
    rationale: "Keep dimensions at 9, but noted as valuable for future"
    note: "Low Fe induces lanthanophore production, enhances Nd uptake"
