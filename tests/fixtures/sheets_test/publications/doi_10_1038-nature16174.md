## Abstract

We demonstrate that rare earth elements (REEs), particularly **europium**, **lanthanum**, and **neodymium**, are essential cofactors for XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenases. These enzymes enable methylotrophic bacteria to oxidize methanol in REE-containing environments.

## Results

Growth assays with Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum showed strict dependence on REEs for growth on methanol. **Europium** concentrations as low as 10 nM supported robust growth, while calcium-dependent MxaF was inactive under these conditions.

## Crystal Structure Analysis

X-ray crystallography revealed that **lanthanide** ions are coordinated in the active site of XoxF by conserved aspartate and glutamate residues, replacing the typical calcium ion found in MxaF enzymes.

## Significance

This work establishes lanthanides as a new class of essential trace elements for life, with implications for microbial ecology and biotechnology.
