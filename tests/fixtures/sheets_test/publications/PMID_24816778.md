## Abstract

Lanthanides such as **europium** and **terbium** have emerged as essential cofactors for bacterial enzymes involved in methanol metabolism. The unique luminescence properties of Eu³⁺ enable sensitive detection assays for rare earth element (REE) uptake and utilization. We review recent advances in understanding lanthanide biochemistry in methylotrophic bacteria.

## Introduction

Methylotrophic bacteria utilize one-carbon compounds as carbon and energy sources. Recent discoveries have revealed that **lanthanide** ions (La³⁺, Ce³⁺, Pr³⁺, Nd³⁺, Eu³⁺, Tb³⁺, etc.) serve as essential cofactors for PQQ-dependent methanol dehydrogenases in the XoxF family.

## Lanthanide Transport Systems

TonB-dependent receptors mediate high-affinity uptake of lanthanide ions complexed with siderophore-like compounds. The **europium** uptake system shows remarkable specificity for light REEs over heavy REEs.

## Time-Resolved Luminescence Assays

The long-lived luminescence of **Eu³⁺** and **Tb³⁺** enables time-resolved assays with high sensitivity. These assays have been instrumental in characterizing lanthanide binding proteins and transport systems.

## Conclusions

Understanding lanthanide biochemistry opens new avenues for biotech applications and provides insights into microbial ecology in REE-enriched environments.
